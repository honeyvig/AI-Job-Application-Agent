-----------------
To develop a highly intelligent AI Job Application Agent that can autonomously manage the entire job application process, several components need to be built, including job listing sourcing, resume customization, LinkedIn outreach, interview scheduling, and performance monitoring. Here's a Python-based framework for this system, broken down into major functionalities.

We'll leverage NLP for resume customization, the LinkedIn API for engagement, web scraping for job listings, and task automation libraries for interview scheduling. Below are code snippets for each component.
1. Job Listing Sourcing & Application Automation

We'll use a job board API (like Indeed or LinkedIn Jobs) to pull job listings and automate the application process.
Example: Using requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping job listings (For LinkedIn job scraping, you might need a LinkedIn API or a scraping service like SerpApi).

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_job_listings(search_term, location):
    url = f'https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q={search_term}&l={location}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    jobs = []
    for job_card in soup.find_all('div', class_='jobsearch-SerpJobCard'):
        job_title = job_card.find('a', {'data-tn-element': 'jobTitle'}).text.strip()
        company = job_card.find('span', class_='company').text.strip()
        location = job_card.find('div', class_='location').text.strip() if job_card.find('div', class_='location') else 'Remote'
        job_link = 'https://www.indeed.com' + job_card.find('a')['href']
        
        jobs.append({
            'title': job_title,
            'company': company,
            'location': location,
            'link': job_link
        })
        
    return jobs

# Example usage
job_listings = scrape_job_listings('Data Scientist', 'New York')
print(job_listings)

This will return job listings that the agent can apply to, based on keywords like "Data Scientist" and the location "New York".
2. Resume Customization (NLP)

We'll use spaCy for NLP to analyze job descriptions and tailor the resume to fit the job description.

import spacy

# Load spaCy's large model for NLP
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

def customize_resume(resume_text, job_description):
    resume_doc = nlp(resume_text)
    job_doc = nlp(job_description)

    # Extract key terms and skills from the job description
    job_keywords = [token.text for token in job_doc if token.pos_ == 'NOUN' or token.pos_ == 'PROPN']

    # Highlight relevant experience in the resume based on extracted keywords
    customized_resume = resume_text
    for keyword in job_keywords:
        if keyword.lower() in resume_text.lower():
            customized_resume = customized_resume.replace(keyword, f'**{keyword}**')  # Highlight keywords in the resume
    
    return customized_resume

# Example usage
resume_text = "Experienced data scientist skilled in Python, machine learning, and data analysis."
job_description = "Looking for a data scientist with strong Python skills, experience in machine learning, and big data analysis."

customized_resume = customize_resume(resume_text, job_description)
print(customized_resume)

This function will highlight keywords from the job description in the resume, customizing the document for the position.
3. LinkedIn Outreach & Engagement Automation

You can use LinkedIn API or tools like LinkedIn scraping tools (e.g., SerpApi) to automate LinkedIn outreach. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll provide a basic automation example.

import time
from linkedin_api import Linkedin  # A Python LinkedIn API wrapper

# Initialize LinkedIn API (You'll need your LinkedIn credentials or use OAuth)
api = Linkedin('email', 'password')

def connect_with_hiring_managers(job_title, company_name):
    # Search for the relevant hiring managers or recruiters
    people = api.search_people(keywords=f'{job_title} {company_name}', limit=5)

    for person in people:
        # Send a connection request with a personalized message
        first_name = person.get('firstName')
        last_name = person.get('lastName')
        message = f"Hi {first_name}, I'm interested in the {job_title} position at {company_name}. Let's connect!"
        
        # Send connection request
        api.add_connection(person['publicIdentifier'], message)
        print(f"Connection request sent to {first_name} {last_name}")
        time.sleep(2)  # Adding delay to avoid spamming

# Example usage
connect_with_hiring_managers('Data Scientist', 'Google')

This script sends a personalized connection request to hiring managers or recruiters on LinkedIn related to a specific job title and company.
4. Interview Scheduling and Communication

For interview scheduling, we'll integrate a calendaring API (like Google Calendar API or Outlook Calendar API) and automate follow-up communication.

from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the credentials and initialize Google Calendar API client
SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'path_to_service_account_file.json'

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)

service = build('calendar', 'v3', credentials=credentials)

def schedule_interview(candidate_email, interview_time):
    event = {
        'summary': 'Job Interview',
        'location': 'Online',
        'description': 'Interview for the Data Scientist position.',
        'start': {
            'dateTime': interview_time.isoformat(),
            'timeZone': 'UTC',
        },
        'end': {
            'dateTime': (interview_time + timedelta(hours=1)).isoformat(),
            'timeZone': 'UTC',
        },
        'attendees': [
            {'email': candidate_email},
        ],
        'reminders': {
            'useDefault': True,
        },
    }

    event = service.events().insert(calendarId='primary', body=event).execute()
    print(f"Interview scheduled: {event['summary']} at {interview_time}")

# Example usage
candidate_email = 'candidate@example.com'
interview_time = datetime(2023, 12, 25, 15, 30)  # Example interview time
schedule_interview(candidate_email, interview_time)

This code uses Google Calendar API to schedule an interview by automatically creating an event in the candidate's calendar.
5. Performance Monitoring & Optimization

Track success metrics like job application responses, interviews scheduled, and optimize the system based on performance.

import pandas as pd

# Dummy data for tracking application success
data = {
    'job_title': ['Data Scientist', 'Software Engineer', 'Data Analyst'],
    'applications_sent': [10, 12, 8],
    'interviews_scheduled': [5, 6, 3],
    'offers_received': [2, 3, 1],
}

# Create DataFrame for monitoring
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate success rates
df['interview_rate'] = df['interviews_scheduled'] / df['applications_sent'] * 100
df['offer_rate'] = df['offers_received'] / df['interviews_scheduled'] * 100

print(df)

This is a basic method for tracking success rates of applications and interviews, helping to adjust the strategy for job applications.
Final Thoughts

The system outlined here automates key processes in the job application pipeline using AI-driven technologies like NLP, web scraping, LinkedIn automation, and interview scheduling. As the project grows, additional features can be added, such as:

    Sentiment analysis for LinkedIn message personalization.
    Automated job matching using ML models to suggest job postings.
    Data privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR).

This should be treated as a base framework. Depending on the specific job board or service you use (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.), the details of the APIs and libraries may vary.
